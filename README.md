### MANUSCRIPT CATEGORIES AND REQUIREMENTS

YOU MUST SUBMIT TEXT, TABLE, AND FIGURE FILES SEPARATELY. IF YOU ARE SUBMITTING LATEX FILES YOU MUST ALSO SUBMIT A PDF FILE FOR REVIEW.

**TEXT**

LaTeX Users: Please use this LaTeX template. Figures must be formatted as either .tif or .eps files and saved separately. Directory structures should not be used when referencing external files. This will cause a corrupted upload into ScholarOne Manuscripts and will result in the cancellation of manuscript submission. Class and style files maybe either internal or external. When submitting your LaTeX files to ScholarOne Manuscripts, please make sure to check the log file provided at submission to see if you are missing the class file from your document.

LaTeX File Submission Guidelines: In addition to your LaTeX files, you must upload a PDF version of your manuscript for review. Please designate this file as the main document. You must also submit all your LaTeX files. To do so, Zip up the directory containing your LaTeX files. This includes the TeX document, all graphics as separate files, any class files, and any bibliography files. This Zip file can be uploaded as a single file into ScholarOne Manuscripts. When uploading a Zip file, simply click the box to "Unpack zip files" and the system will unzip the files.

Technical Support: For PDF conversion support please contact support@scholarone.com. For all other inquiries, please contact your Journal Editorial Office.

**TABLES**

Tables should be created with a word processor and saved in either DOC or RTF format. Do not embed tables in your text. Tables should be on separate pages and saved as one file in DOC format.

**FIGURES**

To ensure the highest print quality, your figures must be submitted in either TIF or EPS format, according to the following minimum resolutions:

1200 dpi (dots per inch) for black and white line art (simple bar graphs, charts, etc.)
300 dpi for halftones (black and white photographs)
600 dpi for combination halftones (photographs that also contain line art such as labeling or thin lines) Figures should be saved as individual files. Vector-based figures (e.g. figures created in Adobe Illustrator) should be submitted in EPS format.
COLOR FIGURES

In addition to the above resolution guidelines, color figures must be submitted in a RGB colorspace.
UNACCEPTABLE FIGURE FORMATS
Do not submit figures in any of the following formats: JPG, GIF, PSD, CRD, PCT, PPT, PDF, XLS, DOC, BMP, 123 (or other Lotus formats).

Online help is available to you at all times during the process. You are also able to exit/re-enter at any stage before finally "submitting" your work. All submissions are kept strictly confidential. If you have any questions, please contact ScholarOne at support@scholarone.com or use the Help link on the ScholarOne site. You may also contact the Journal's Editorial Office, sam_ed@wiley.com.

**DATA SETS**

A key goal of Statistical Analysis and Data Mining is to encourage collaboration across disciplines on the analysis of data from practical problems. Reproducibility of data further enables collaboration and allows for a deeper understanding of the problems being solved. As a result, we have decided to implement a new data policy for all papers published in Statistical Analysis and Data Mining.

Upon submission, authors should upload all associated datasets, code, and software used in their article. Files should be uploaded as Data Files within the online submission system. Data should be clearly labeled and, along with an explanatory README file, saved as a zip file (or a similar archiving tool). A detailed description of the data should include all variables, along with the code used to analyze the data. For larger datasets, an author might find it more practical to post a dataset in a publicly available repository, in which case the article should include a link to the DOI of the published dataset within the article.

For authors who are unable to post their data, code, or software due to NDA/ownership restrictions, they should provide detailed instructions describing where everything can be located. If the supplementary material is not publicly available, papers will still be considered for publication, but we ask authors to provide a clear explanation upon submission.

Upon acceptance, Data Files will be automatically deposited to figshare, by Wiley, on behalf of the authors. A CC-Zero (no rights reserved) license will be applied by default. The data will be assigned a single DOI and will be automatically and permanently associated with the HTML version of the published manuscript.

For more information, please read our Data Sharing Policy.

### PREPARING THE SUBMISSION 

**Parts of the Manuscript**

The manuscript should be submitted in separate files: main text file; figures.

**Title Page**

The title page should contain:

i. A short informative title that contains the major key words. The title should not contain abbreviations (see Wiley's best practice SEO tips);
ii. A short running title of less than 40 characters;
iii. The full names of the authors; 
iv. The author's institutional affiliations where the work was conducted, with a footnote for the author’s present address if different from where the work was conducted; 
v. Acknowledgments.

**Authorship**

Please refer to the journal’s authorship policy the Editorial Policies and Ethical Considerations section for details on author listing eligibility.

**Acknowledgments**

Contributions from anyone who does not meet the criteria for authorship should be listed, with permission from the contributor, in an Acknowledgments section. Financial and material support should also be mentioned. Thanks to anonymous reviewers are not appropriate.

**Conflict of Interest Statement**

Authors will be asked to provide a conflict of interest statement during the submission process. For details on what to include in this section, see the section ‘Conflict of Interest’ in the Editorial Policies and Ethical Considerations section below. Submitting authors should ensure they liaise with all co-authors to confirm agreement with the final statement.

**Abstract**

The abstract should briefly (80-200words) present, in one paragraph, the problem and solution approach and state the major findings and conclusions. It should be self-explanatory and suitable for reproduction without rewriting. Footnotes or undefined abbreviations may not be used. If a reference must be cited, complete publication data must be given.

**Keywords**

Please provide up to 10 keywords that reflect the content of your manuscript. In addition to facilitating indexing of articles, our keyword system assists in the assignment of qualified reviewers for your manuscript.

**References and Notes.**

List references in alphabetical order by the lead author's last name. In text citations should use the # sign in brackets to represents the order that the citation is mentioned in the text of the paper. For example, [5] would indicate that this is the fifth citation found in the text.

For more information about this reference style, please refer to the AMS Author Handbook.

**Supporting Information**

The Supporting Information format of this journal can accommodate and make readily available almost any type of supplementary figures or data (e.g., reproductions of spectra, experimental procedures, tabulated data, expanded discussion of peripheral findings,etc.).The author should include a Supporting Information Available statement that describes the material at the end of the printed manuscript text.Consult a current issue of the Journal for the proper wording of this statement. Supporting Information should be clear and of high contrast(suitable for direct photo reproduction) and submitted in quadruplicate on 8.5-×11-in. paper. All pages of Supporting Information must be consecutively numbered. Captions or legends for figures, spectra, etc., must appear directly on the figure. Supporting Information is available free of charge via the Internet (http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/).

**Acknowledgments**

This section should acknowledge financial support, technical assistance, advice from colleagues, gifts, etc. Permission must be received from persons whose contribution to the work is acknowledged in the manuscript.

**Tables**

Tabulation of experimental results is encouraged when this leads to more effective presentation or to more economical use of space. Tables should be numbered consecutively with Arabic numerals. Provide a brief title with each table and a brief heading for each column. Clearly indicate the units of measure (preferably SI). Data should be rounded to the nearest significant figure. Explanatory material referring to the whole table is to be included as a footnote to the title (a). Footnotes in tables should be given lower case letter designations and cited in the tables as italicized superscripts. Tables that require special treatment, such as insertion of arrows or other special symbols under or over alphanumeric characters, or contain many structures should be submitted as camera-ready copy. All tables should be cited in the text.

**Illustrations**

The quality of the illustrations printed in your paper depends on the quality of the originals you provide. Electronic submission of illustrations is encouraged. Preferred formats for graphics and artwork are TIFF (tagged image file format) and EPS (Encapsulated PostScript). John Wiley & Sons, Inc. journal pages are now produced completely electronically. In preparing illustrations, contrast is important. Use dark black ink on high quality, smooth, opaque white paper. Ordinary white bond paper works well. Avoid tracing paper or textured "artist" papers.

Illustrations must fit a one- or two-column format on the journal page. For efficient use of journal space, single column illustrations are preferred.

Mininum Width
Maximum Width
Maximum Depth	Single (preferred)

8 cm (3.125 in)
23 cm (9 in)	Double
9 cm (3.5 in)
16.5 cm (6.5 in)
23 cm (9 in)

For best results, submit illustrations in the actual size at which they should appear in the journal. Original illustrations which do not need to be reduced to fit a single or double column will yield the best quality. Lettering should be no smaller than 4.5 points (the Helvetica type-face works well for lettering). Lines should be no thinner than 0.5 point. Lettering and lines should be of uniform density. If you must submit artwork that must be reduced,use larger lettering and thicker lines so that, when reduced,the artwork meets the above-mentioned parameters. Avoid using complex textures and shading to achieve a three-dimensional effect. To show a pattern, choose a simple cross-hatch design.

Color: All color figures will be reproduced in full color in the online edition of the journal at no cost to the authors. Authors are encouraged to submit color illustrations that highlight the text and convey essential scientific information. For best reproduction, bright, clear colors should be used. Dark colors against a dark background do not reproduce well; please place your color images against a white background whenever possible. Please email sam_ed@wiley.comfor further information.
